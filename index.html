      <h2>doin' stuff and makin' things</h2>
      <p>
        i suck at c so i write other languages. most recently i fell in love
        with zig and odin, and fell out of love with rust (maybe i should expand
        on that one day).<br>
        anyway, here's a list of things i like (at least currently):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>zig</li>
        <li>odin</li>
        <li>
          9p (thanks to FOSSUnleashed for getting me interested in it in the
          first place, i'm working on a zig implementation of the protocol.)
        </li>
        <li>making my own stuff for shits and giggles</li>
        <li>making charcuterie at home</li>
        <li>pizza</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        one day i would really like this website to be a blog, but i'm not good
        at writing in general, and i don't believe i have much to say that would
        be of interest to people. please do let me know if that's something you
        would read.
        <br>
        my main passion is starting projects and never going actually finishing
        them. a few of them, in no particular order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code><a href="https://github.com/blurrycat/nine">nine</a></code>: a collection of
          things related to 9p in go. more of an exploration thing than an
          actual project, though i have some ideas i would like to make with 9p.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="https://github.com/blurrycat/gitz">gitz</a></code>: libgit2 bindings
          for zig. very much a work in progress but despite what the readme can
          say, i would like to have a full and ergonomic binding to everything
          libgit2 offers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code><a href="https://github.com/blurrycat/lightctl">lightctl</a></code>:
          little utility i wrote to control backlight on my laptop, because i
          apparently can't google shit and didn't find about brightnessctl until
          after i was done with it. oh well...<br>
          i'm not doing much with this one and if i do it'll be to rewrite it in
          zig, but feel free to use it, at this point i think it should work
          pretty good in general. if you find a bug i may fix it anyway so
          don't hesitate to report it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>zp</code>: my own (unpublished) shell prompt that I need to publish. this was
          actually the main driver behind <code>gitz</code> initially.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>cfgfs</code> (name tbd): a configuration management system built
          over the 9p protocol based on a pull architecture (more salt, less
          ansible). there is currently no code for that as i'm still writing
          the spec for it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>grit</code>: self-hosted git hosting software for individuals
          and small teams that value simplicity and speed over features that
          have nothing to do in a git hosting software. this was initially being
          built in rust, but I later revised my position, chose pragmatism, and
          started working on it again, in ruby, with rails. i may write about
          this particular decision one day.
        </li>
        <li>
          probably another project here in about 2 weeks, once i get bored of
          the others.
        </li>
      </ul>
